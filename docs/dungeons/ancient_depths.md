### Boss Behaviours
The fight consists of two main phases, one being its main phase, and the other being its rage phase.

Phase 1: The boss will loosely follow you in this phase, he stays at a distance while still tracking you and moving closer forward when shooting out some attacks. He never jumps or sits close to you.

He will use 4 main attacks in this phase, the first being a grey bullet shotgun, he shoots out 6 of these bullets and all of these do around 100 damage, these move quite fast so it's recommended to stay back to dodge these.

The hardest hitting attack is the wavy shots he shoots in a 90 degree cone, he will shoot out 4 grey shots and 4 green shots. The grey shots deal around 200 damage and inflicts armor broken on the player. The green shots deal around 200 damage that inflicts bleeding on the player.

Another attack he uses is a burst of green shots he shoots out, these do not deal high damage but do inflict bleeding.

The last attack only comes in after minions, he shoots out 4 white shots that deal 80 damage and don't give any debuffs.

The other part of the fight is the minions he spawns in, these don't have too much health but do 120 damage per shot(non-armor piercing damage) and shoot decently fast, you should focus these down if you want to live.

#### Rage Phase
This phase uses the same attacks as Phase 1 but with a different movement pattern, he only uses the green burst shots and the large cone of grey and green shots. While shooting this he will jump at you and chase you the whole fight, he will not spawn any minions and will do this until he dies.

# First Boss Tips & Tricks:
1. It is not recommended to solo this on a melee due to the high damage shotguns.

2. There is a delay between the grey/green shotgun so you can use this to go in and attack the boss when his shots are lower damage.

3. Rage phase will jump often so it is recommended to only go in and attack him close range when he has just jumped and shot the grey/green shotgun.

4. If you are melee, it's safest to just sit back and relax, letting the ranged classes do the heavy lifting for you.

# Second Boss: Xanarich

### Boss Behaviours

The first thing the boss does is spawn in 3 minions. These minions all hit very hard and inflict different debuffs: quiet, bleeding and unstable. They shoot out many shots each and all of them do 100-200 damage, they will all circle around one point in the top right and the boss will be invulnerable until they have all been killed. If you don't have high dps in this phase you will not be able to kill the minions as they heal.

After the minions have been killed he will shoot out a ring of shots around him, these shots all sicken and deal over 100 damage each. He will then start spawning in little fly minions, these will frequently shoot out a 50 damage shot that petrifies the player, you should immediately focus these when they spawn as petrify can ruin your fight if you get hit by it.

He will then move onto a shotgun chase phase, he will shoot out rows of shots at the player, he will shoot out a medium range cone of 6, 150 damage piercing shots as well as throwing a 160 damage bomb and an even shorter shotgun of high damage shots that will instantly kill you if you are hit by all of it. He will then move back into the middle and start a short rotational phase of 140 damage shots that inflict slow, during this rotational phase he will heal. After this he spawns in the 3 minions from the beginning of the fight for the last time during this fight. He loops back around into this pattern until you push him into rage phase.

#### Rage Phase
This rage phase isn't too hard of a rage phase. He doesn't chase you, instead just standing still and shooting out the same shots as before (the medium range cone of 6, 150 damage piercing shots as well as the 90 damage sick shots). But this time he shoots them out in a burst, while throwing the 160 damage bomb and spawning in the minions that petrify.

# Second Boss Tips & Tricks
1. It is not recommended to solo this on melee.

2. During minion phase you can drag the boss out of the boss room into the first boss's room (which is larger and has more area for you to  if you have enough speed so it is easier for you to focus the minions.

3. Always focus the little flies he spawns

4. You can run back to the previous rooms to heal if you get low health, although the boss does heal too.
