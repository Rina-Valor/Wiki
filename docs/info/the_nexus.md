# Housing

Valor is home to Housing, a system that lets players create houses to hang out in or access certain tiles & placable objects.

## The Home Depot

***The Home Depot is where most housing content can be bought or accessed, with a few others coming as rewards from the battle pass. It is located under the spawn.***

![homedepot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a06d600-6e8f-4435-a69b-03044af1ca1c)

***Items in the will cost either Gold, Fame, Kantos, or Onrane and you can upgrade your max housing size with gold or kantos via the green allow in the top left of the menu shop.***

## House Editing

***The Housing Editor can be found on the main menu at the bottom right of your characters screen.***
  
![housemenu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e17b193b-d9ee-4e84-bfcc-a23574162186)

Clicking it will open the editor where you can place the tiles & objects you have on your account in any configuration you want (as long as you have a spawn location) and then Save(Submit) it to the server for you or anyone else to visit later.

## Visiting Houses

**The command `/vhome [playername]` can be ran ingame to visit their housing, this works for your own house as well. Anybody can do this at any time, even if the owner is offline or elsewhere in Valor.**

![vhome](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f84354b2-5f95-4104-a9d1-37ebab180aaa)

## Functionality
  
***The main draws of housing are for creating art, showing off your wealth with an expensive house, having somewhere private for popping keys or what have you, or for using private target dummies to test your damage or other effects.***

# Loot Boxes

***Valor has various types of lootboxes; do not worry they all except one are obtained by playing. Each of these lootboxes have different item pools and drop locations, but they can all be checked from the same location: the top left of your screen whilst in the nexus or vault. On the Lootboxes Page, you can find Gold, Silver and Bronze Lootboxes, as well as your collected Pack Rat bags. Gold, Silver and Bronze lootboxes drop in the Realm, while Pack Rat bags can be found while doing ascended dungeons.***

# Marketplace

![marketplace](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c9dbfde-9847-4ce4-924f-836bb4a6d20f)

***The Marketplace is an incredibly important part of Valor, and acts as the location to buy and sell items for gold. Not all players are allowed to use the Marketplace, as Elite Accounts are not allowed to buy or sell items from other non-elite account players, thus they aren't allowed to use the market. All transactions on the marketplace have an 8% Tax put onto the seller of an item. It also costs 50 gold to remove an item if it isn't your most recently placed item.***

![markaplce](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/352f29d7-fd28-408d-b532-99fb915f7eea)

***You can access the Marketplace GUI by talking to the Human NPCs within the marketplace. In this GUI you can sort every item currently on the market, see all the items you have listed on the market, and you can even buy items directly from the GUI instead of waiting for it to be sorted in!***
