# General 

- ***In general, respect each other and do not run around ruining the atmosphere for others just so you can have fun. Below you can find more in-depth explanations of the main rules. If you are still unsure whether something is against the rules, ask a staff member. Even if a rule is unclear, ask a staff member, as the staff's interpretation of the rules is the only valid one.***

 - Do **NOT** lie to staff.
 
 - Do **NOT** associate with cheaters.
 
 - Do **NOT** dispute the bans of other players.

# In Game

 - Exploiting of any kind is **NOT** tolerated.
    - If caught, the punishment and punishment length is determined by the severity of the exploit. This is including but definitely **NOT** limited to: duping, elite account exploits or any other kind of exploits for that matter. If you have to ask if what you're doing is an exploit, it probably is and you may want to contact a moderator to find out if you're breaking this rule.

 - Do **NOT** beg for items.
 
 - Do **NOT** gamble.
 
 - Do **NOT** attempt to ruin the gameplay experience for other users.
 
 - Do **NOT** rush ahead in large dungeons such as Titan Lava Walk.
 
 - Do **NOT** "key". This is where you open a key over top of a raid portal.
 
 - Do **NOT** harass, or purposefully kill other players. (E.g, using group speedy right beside lava with clear intent to kill players.)
 
 - Do **NOT** associate with cheaters.
 
 - Do **NOT** use an objectionable username. (You will be renamed)
 
 - Follow all Ingame Chat rules below where applicable. E.g, disregard anything about images.
 
 - No indecent themes. No attacking other uses through slurs, or anything that can be constructed as harassment.
 
 - Harassment of other users will **NOT** be tolerated. This includes threats, repetitive name calling, or harassment of a person's family and/or personal life.

 - Anyone caught redistributing the testing client to non donors will forfeit their rank/and or risk a ban.

# Discord And In Game Chat

 - Double pings/Multiple pinging in Notifcation-squad will result in warnings and mutes.
 
 - **ONLY** ping staff in appropriate situations. Please use our support channels first.
 
 - Follow all pinned message rules in channels, and chat in the proper channels.

- We welcome all forms of constructive, civil, and non-personal criticism. However, we reserve the right to moderate any user who interprets this as a right to misinform, defame, or spread extreme negativity about the project intentionally.
 
 - Like the rule above, pings for something other than the pinned allowed things will also result in 3 strikes. This includes false pings. An exhaustive list of allowed pings is in #notification-squad.
 
 - Speaking non english is fine in moderation. We understand not every single player is an english speaker, so a few sentences is fine here and there, or a small conversation. The whole chat becoming non english will be asked to swap back over to english, or move to private chats.
 
 - Do **NOT** discuss sexual or indecent themes.
 
 - Harassment of other users will **NOT** be tolerated. This includes threats, repetitive name calling, or harassment of a person's family and/or personal life.
 
 - Do **NOT** post harmful content.
    - This includes but is not limited to steam stealers, hacked clients, NSFW content. Anything that could bring harm to another user or Valor itself. This includes partial nudity.

 - Do **NOT** be homophobic or use homophobic slurs.

<TabItem value="RWT" label="RWT" default>

# RWT
 
 - Exchanging other game items is unsupported (This includes other private servers). Meaning it will receive no Moderation Support nor help if the trade results in a scam. The only thing we can do from our side is a ban to the scammer from our server and Discord.

 - All talk in the #rwt channel should be strictly related to RWT offers. If you are discussing a deal, please do so in DMs.

 - Buying duped/exploited items will result in the Moderation team taking away all the items a duper/exploiter sold if he is found out. It's on you to file a refund with the user after that.

 - Scamming and scam attempts are punishable with a permanent ban both on Discord and on Valor, on all accounts.

 - Any support of payment plans ( ie. Selling an item and paying it off day by day is unsupported and will not receive support regardless of vouches. What this means: "If you break up a deal into multiple payments,e.g $50/m for four months", we don't support or offer any kind of assistance/coverage no matter their vouches. You may still enter into these, but like prod RWT or any other unsupported game, we will not be able to offer assistance other than a ban to the scammer )

 - Trading with someone with less than 5 vouches will result in no Moderation Support. Unless you would like to request a Moderator Middleman through our #create-ticket system. Moderators show up on our sidebar, and will generally MM for free or a small fee depending on how big the transaction is, etc.

 - (They will not handle physical funds in most cases, unless pre-agreed in writing by all parties.)

 **Any decision by a moderator is final. They may ban/punish for reasons not stated here if they feel your intent is to be destructive or harmful to the server and/or the community. That includes RWT deals that were not followed as per our RWT rules.**

# Payment Plans

**Payment plans are officially unsupported. What this means: "If you break up a deal into multiple payments,e.g $50/m for four months", we don't support or offer any kind of assistance/coverage no matter their vouches. You may still enter into these, but like prod RWT or any other unsupported game, we will not be able to offer assistance other than a ban to the scammer.**

### Reason
 - This was a frequent problem across 2021, and was a major problem in the last few months. These don't fit well in our current vouch and tracking system, and open up the traders to multiple opportunities for something to go awry. It's almost impossible for us to keep track of what was paid, and overall does not seem to work in our ecosystem based on the amount of problems.

## Any decision by a moderator is final. They may ban/punish for reasons not stated here, if they feel your intent is to be destructive or harmful to the server and/or the community. If you are banned or punished by a moderator, it is FORBIDDEN to make a secondary account to avoid these punishments.
